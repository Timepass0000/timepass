        <p>Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......... so here's a note, im just writing whatever comes to mind Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy we have been together for almost 7 months damnn, also sorry i couldn't do most of the stuff i planned cuz we can't go out but take this as it's replacement (bag magic trick). Haa soo, u remember i wrote a note similar to this during new years, i told i will be less childish and more mature, how am i doing on that? (just a little checkup). ummm so i dont think u realise how much i have grown attached to you, ukk.. i am sad when u are.. and get happy when u are.. blahhblahh but i like myself a lotttttttt whenever i am with you. I am truly happy that i asked you out and made the first move, udk how much i was panicking hehe but it was all worth it... my best decision in all my life... U mean a lot to me. IDK if i am allowed to ask this question butt "Will u be my Valentine?üíï"</p>
